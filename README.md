Finder
=====
Finder is an intuitive interface for regular people to find interesting images in NASA's near-real-time satellite data.

You can try it at [wcarss.ca/finder](http://wcarss.ca/finder)

License
======
Finder makes use of a modified version of [jTinder](https://github.com/do-web/jTinder), so it provisionally uses the GNU Public License Version 2.0 until I learn to what extent that is actually required.
